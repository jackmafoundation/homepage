Li Song's team said that Radixivir is most potential treatment for the new coronavirus. However, the drug is not yet approved. The original R&D company, Gilead, only has 7000-10,000 bottles of powder needles, which is enough to serve 800 people. It is far from meeting the current needs of infection prevention and control in China.

The expection of the project led by  Li Song is that, in an emergency situation, daily production is enough for clinical use after two months. The project is to complete the intermediate test and industrialization of Radixivir within three months, to complete the pharmaceutical research of Radixivir injection within six months, and to get an approval of new Coronavirus drugs from the National Medical Products Administration within 10 months.  

According to Xinhua Newsy, with the support of the Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Health Commission, the National Medical Products Administration and other departments, Radixivir has completed the registration clinical trials. Patients with severe pneumonia started to receive new medicines on February 6.

The remaining funds will be used to support top scientific institutions and outstanding scientific researchers to cooperate in the research and prevention of the new coronaviruses all over the world.

On the day when the donation was announced, Jack Ma said, "Although researchers are devoting themselves to develop treatments and vaccines against the new coronavirus, it is hard to get it done in a short period of time. We hope that the epidemic can be completely controlled before the vaccine is developed, but we also know that the struggle between humans and the virus is a long road, which requires more patience, accumulation, confidence and hope.
