> Our united will to fight against the epidemic situation of novel coronavirus pneumonia is stronger than a fortress.

The epidemic of COVID-19 is touching people's hearts. In the afternoon, we announced that we would donate RMB 100 million (USD 14.26 million) to support the research and development of the vaccine for COVID-19.

Within that donation, RMB 20 million (USD 2.85 million) was donated respectively to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering for the current special research and development of virus vaccine of their professional research institutions. The rest of the funds will be used to support domestic and foreign top scientific research institutions and scientific research personnel to cooperate to carry out the prevention and treatment work of COVID-19.

We know very well that although researchers have been in a race against the clock and trying their best, it is not an easy thing for the vaccine to be put into use overnight as there is an extensive process from the research phase, trials to public usage. While we hope that the epidemic will be completely controlled before the vaccine comes out, we also know that the fight between human beings and viruses is a long road â€“ one which requires patience and experience, as well as more confidence and hope. To this end, the Jack Ma Foundation will do its best to provide more help for the development and knowledge - buildup of medical science.

At the same time, Alibaba Group announced that it will also provide all the AI computing power required for the research and development of virus vaccines and new drugs to public scientific research institutions for free.

At this moment, we appeal to and support the cooperation of all researchers and research institutions. Let us come together, work together, pool human and material resources together to give confidence to the Chinese people and to all humans so we overcome diseases.

Stay strong Wuhan! Stay strong China!  Stay Strong everyone!
