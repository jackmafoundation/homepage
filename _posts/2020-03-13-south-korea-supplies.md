The 1 million masks to be donated to South Korea are ready for departure in Cainiaoâ€™s warehouse. They will arrive in South Korea at the fastest speed possible and will be delivered to the most needy via the South Korea Red Cross Association.

When we were facing difficult times, donations from South Korea were a huge relief. Now South Korea is facing difficulties and we seek to show our support!

As close neighbors, we bear the wind and rain together! We hope the situation in South Korea gets better soon!
