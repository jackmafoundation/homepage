The first round of epidemic prevention supplies donated to Europe will arrive at Liege Airport, Belgium, this afternoon. The 1.8 million masks and 100,000 virus detection kits raised by the Jack Ma Foundation and the Alibaba Foundation will also arrive shortly and will be donated to countries with severe outbreak such as Italy and Spain.

Although cross-border delivery of epidemic prevention goods is limited due to a range of difficulties, the European eWTP hub at the Liege Airport is fortunately still in good operation. Thankfully, our donations for Europe can be continuously delivered to places in need through the life-channels that the European eWTP hub is building across Europe.

Thousands of miles away, we race against time, to help with this global emergency. Together, we will get through these tough times!
