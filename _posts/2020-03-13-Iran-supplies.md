Even thousands of miles away, we are still neighbors. Distance wonâ€™t stand in the way of us supporting each other.

The outbreak is becoming more and more severe in Iran and there is a shortage of healthcare supplies. Seeing so many people infected, especially many women and children, we empathize with their pain. Over the past few days, we have made a strong effort and raised 1 million masks. Although we face a long journey, and the delivery will be difficult, we will do our best. We will dispatch the goods as soon as possible, and we hope that they can alleviate the urgent need, protect the children of Iran, and help to end the epidemic as soon as possible, to make the world healthy again. We wish for safety and peace in the world!

After donating 1 million masks to Japan and South Korea respectively, this is the third round of donations by JMF to international countries facing a severe outbreak.
