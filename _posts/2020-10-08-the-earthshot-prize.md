The Jack Ma Foundation on October 8, 2020 pledged an initial donation of three million pounds ($3.8 million) to support one of the most prestigious global environment initiatives in history.

The Earthshot Prize, spearheaded by Prince William and the Royal Foundation, is a 10-year commitment to fund at least 50 solutions for some of the world's most complicated and pressing environmental issues. The initiative aims to combat challenges across five major areas, including climate and energy, nature and biodiversity, oceans, air pollution and fresh water. 

Every year, five winners will be awarded 1 million pounds each to carry out their environmental research and endeavors. They will also receive the support needed to scale their solutions with businesses and government entities. 

"We only have one Earth in this world and the pandemic has made it clear that mankind cannot live without the Earth, but that Earth can live without mankind. Today we all live in the same forest that is already on fire. If we work together, we can all do a little bit today and overcome our challenges," said Alibaba Group and Jack Ma Foundation founder Jack Ma, who has joined as a Global Alliance Founding Partner to the prize alongside Jack Ma Foundation.

The initiative's name is inspired by John F. Kennedy's "moonshot" ambition to accelerate new ideas and innovations by putting man on the moon by the end of 1960s.

The Earthshot Prize is intended to foster a decade of environmental action, to motivate people all over the world to work together to repair the planet and to celebrate the people and places driving positive change, said the organizer. 

Ma will also be involved as an Earthshot Prize Council Member, who will help select the winners with the support of a panel of environmental experts. Fellow Prize Council members include Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah, Cate Blanchett, Christiana Figueres, Dani Alves, Sir David Attenborough, Hindou Ibrahim, Indra Nooyi, Naoko Yamazaki, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Shakira, Yao Ming and the prize's founder, Prince William. 

"The Earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice: either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve," said Prince William on the Royal Foundation's website. "People can achieve great things. The next ten years present us with one of our greatest tests – a decade of action to repair the Earth."

Nominations for the prize will open on Nov. 1. Anyone – from individuals to teams and collaborations – with a workable, evidence-based solution is invited to apply.
