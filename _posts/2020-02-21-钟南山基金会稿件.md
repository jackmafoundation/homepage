> With JMF’s  100 million yuan donation towards the R & D Fund for a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, all parties are convinced that they will make key breakthroughs in the R & D of new anti-coronavirus drugs and technology for clinical treatment.

A cooperation framework agreement was jointly signed this afternoon by the Jack Ma Foundation, Alibaba Cloud, Zhong Nanshan's medical foundation and the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health. The cooperation aims to support the development of key technologies for clinical diagnosis, drugs and vaccine of novel coronavirus at the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health through a donation to the Zhon NanShan foundation.

According to the agreement, the Jack Ma Foundation will donate 6 million yuan to Zhong Nanshan’s medical foundation, which will be used to support urgently needed critical coronavirus research at Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health.

Furthermore, to provide technological support to the project,  Alibaba Cloud will provide AI computing power free of charge to directly support research programs on the development of new drugs, viral gene sequencing and protein screening. IAlibaba cloud also plans to discuss relevant in-depth technical support cooperation with the protocol partners on the construction of: a National respiratory-disease intelligent early warning system, a cloud-based research platform focused on respiratory-system diseases & infectious disease, an open-collaborative information sharing system focused on respiratory disease treatment research and best-practices to improve the efficiency of early warning detection and transmission of information.

In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Jack Ma Foundation announced an emergency donation of a 100-million-yuan to support the research and development of novel coronavirus drugs and vaccines. Last week,oOn February 7th, it signed a cooperation framework agreement with the Chinese Academy of Engineering. A 5-person research team of experts and academics recommended by the Academy of Engineering will receive research funding totalling 20 million yuan for urgent research programs.Among them, the Guangzhou respiratory health research institute led  led by the Zhong Nanshan team has received funding of 4 million yuan. Based on the cooperation framework agreement announced today, the four parties have joined their hands together. The two independent projects will provide a total of 10 million yuan to Zhong Nanshan, which will focus on accelerating the research and development of new drugs and key technologies for clinical treatment and diagnosis of novel corona virus (COVID-19).

In less than two weeks, the Jack Ma Foundation’s 100 million yuan donation has launched two concrete programs to address corona virus. Based on the progress of the Zhongshan team, the foundation will continue to discuss further cooperation with all parties to the agreement and provide necessary and continuous support for the follow-up research.

We firmly believe that with the joint efforts of all parties in the agreement, we will be able to make key breakthroughs in research and  development of new anti-coronavirus drugs and in the development of key technological tools for clinical diagnosis and treatment. We shall win the fight against coronavirus!
